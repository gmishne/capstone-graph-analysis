# Introduction

This domain will investigate analysis of data lying on irregular strucutre, or graphs. This domain centers around understanding graph-based data  and graphs as data. To approach this problem we will mainly be focsing on Graph Neural Networks.

Graphs and networks are playing an increasing role in modern machine learning and signal processing. We can view graphs as an augemented data, where in addition to have a feature representation for every datapoint (nodes in the graphs), we also have knowledge of the interactions and connectivity between points (graph edges). Graphs-based data is prevalent across domains such as biology (neuronal networks in the brain), computer science (social networks), electrical engineering (sensor networks), civil engineering (traffic networks) and many, many more.

## Result replication (introduction to topic)

We will delve into this area via the following primary paper:


The latter-half of Quarter 1 will introduce you to other topics to
inform possible avenues for further research:

# Section Participation

Participation in the weekly discussion section is *mandatory*. Each
week, you are responsible for doing the reading/task assigned in the
[schedule](#schedule). Come to section prepared to ask questions about
and discuss the results of these tasks.

Each week, turn in answers to the weekly questions to Canvas. These
questions are meant to focus your work for the week and help prepare
you for discussion. If you have questions about your work, please ask
them in section or office hours (I will rarely comment on your
submission).

You are responsible for the entire weekly reading/task, even if
portions are not covered in the weekly questions. The weekly tasks are
the building blocks for the project proposals/assignments due at the
end of the quarter.
